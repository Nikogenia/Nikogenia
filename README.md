I'm a big fan of discovering new technologies and love Python. In the past I made an [arcade machine](https://github.com/Nikogenia/MspArcade) for my school
and worked on a Minecraft server network management engine [MineTower](https://github.com/Nikogenia/MineTower). As the software lead and flight director of
[Space Balloon](https://github.com/BOGYLI/SpaceBalloon) I spent 800 hours on a very ambitious high school project. We are launching a stratospheric balloon
with live video and measurements including a fully featured YouTube Livestream and much more!
